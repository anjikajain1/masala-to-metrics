<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>Background</h3>

The dataset we chose was Recipes and Ratings. These 2 datasets were scrapped from food.com, a popular online platform for sharing a discovering new recipes. The datasets we worked with were divided in two main components. 

RAW_recipes.csv: Contains all details about recipes, including preparation time, number of steps in recipe, and nutritional information.

RAW_interactions.csv: Includes user reviews and ratings for recipes found in RAW_recipes.csv

Question: What are the different aspects that could impact the calorie content of recipes?
